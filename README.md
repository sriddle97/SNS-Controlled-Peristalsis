# SNS_Controlled_Peristalsis
This repository contains code that runs the SNS coupled oscillator simulation for control of the peristaltic locomotion of a worm robot as well as the stability analysis of the system's limit cycle. The 2D purely kinematic model can be found in the "Controller Design and 2D Simulation" folder. The 3D model which incorporates soft bodied physics and dynamics is located in the "3D Soft Physics Model" folder. This model much more accurately simulates the behavior of a physical worm robot.

## 2D Simulation
### Running the model
This can be found in SNS_Worm_Sim.m. Everything you need to just run the model is contained in this file.

### Stability Analysis
This is contained in the files labeled stability.m and Riddle_cycle_new.m. Both must be located in the same folder for stability.m to run properly.

## 3D Simulation
### Building the Model

### Necessary Packages

### Running the Model
