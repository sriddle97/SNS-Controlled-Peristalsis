# SNS_Controlled_Peristalsis
This repository contains code that runs the SNS coupled oscillator simulation for control of the peristaltic locomotion of a worm robot as well as the stability analysis of the system's limit cycle.

### Simulation
This can be found in SNS_Worm_Sim.m

### Stability Analysis
This is contained in the files labeled stability.m and Riddle_cycle_new.m. Both must be located in the same folder for stability.m to run properly.
